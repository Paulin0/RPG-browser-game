I want to make a simple game.  To help practice what I have learned during the past months 

Vision:
I like text based games, so I will make one in the future and turn it mobile so I can play it whenever. 

Anyways, the vision I have for this game is to make it a kind of watered down version of d&d.  

You will start by making an account.  Then you create your character and probably choose where to allocate your stats and the type of player you are. 
Then you go to the town square, from there you can travel to different places like the tavern, library, training facility, but this will probably be broken down into sections. Like the market, the training alley or something idk. 
The most important part are the dungeons. I want to use randomness to choose the type of enemies, and how much you and them deal damage. If you die, you will loose all or half of your money because people will have to come and get you.  Also I want to allow in game chat.  And like, have ranking and stuff. Especially a personal one. 

I will probably start by making a rough version of it with just basic html, css, and JavaScript.  After I learn backend and authentication I will then apply it to make it basically a multiplayer game. But it's first stage will jsut live here as a single plaster.  This is my first big project, and I'm exited because this is the first game I've ever made, I will try to do the things I wish they did.  But if it's too hard I'll make a note on it and come back to it later when I know how to implode my it. 

Anyways. I hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Š.
